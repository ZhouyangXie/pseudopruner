1. Support more layers with parameters such as DeConv

2. A more stable way to implement infer_masks

3. Implement more one-shot pruners

4. Implement real pruning(a light model ready for inference)

5. Reconstruct this lib in an OOP manner(define a class to wrap torch.nn.Module)
and more importantly, reduce the change on model itself
